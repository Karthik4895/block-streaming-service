# Monitoring & Production Strategy

This document outlines how you would monitor the block streaming system in a real-world production environment.

## Monitoring in Production

### Key Monitoring Practices:

1. **Structured Logging**:
   - Each processed block is logged in JSON format.
   - Includes: `block_number`, `timestamp`, `transactions`, `provider`.

2. **Alerting Triggers**:
   - No new block detected for X seconds (e.g., 60 seconds).
   - Provider switched more than N times in Y minutes.
   - Consecutive RPC failures or timeouts.

3. **Log Aggregation**:
   - Use tools like:
     - ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
     - Grafana Loki + Promtail
     - AWS CloudWatch Logs

4. **Health Check Endpoint (Future Plan)**:
   - Provide a `/health` or `/status` HTTP endpoint.
   - Could expose:
     - `last_processed_block`
     - `current_provider`
     - `block_lag_seconds`
     - `rpc_error_count`

## Metrics to Track

| Metric Name             | Description                                     |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `block_lag_seconds`     | Time gap between current time and last block   |
| `provider_switch_count` | Counts failovers due to provider issues        |
| `rpc_errors_total`      | Number of RPC request failures                 |
| `rpc_latency_ms`        | Average RPC call duration per provider         |
| `blocks_processed`      | Total number of blocks processed               |
| `block_integrity_errors`| Missing or malformed block data                |

##  Improvements If More Time Was Available

1. **WebSocket Support**:
   - Replace polling with WebSocket subscriptions for real-time block updates.

2. **Persistent State**:
   - Store last processed block in Redis or SQLite to resume after restart.

3. **Block Reorg Handling**:
   - Detect reorgs using `parentHash` and rollback if needed.

4. **Circuit Breaker for Providers**:
   - Mark failing providers as “down” for X minutes and backoff.

5. **Metrics Dashboard**:
   - Export metrics to Prometheus and visualize with Grafana.

6. **Multi-Network Support**:
   - Add capability to stream from multiple chains (e.g., Polygon, BSC).

7. **Retry with Backoff**:
   - Retry failed block fetches with exponential backoff before switching.

8. **Secure Secrets Handling**:
   - Use encrypted secret management or Docker secrets instead of `.env`.

By combining structured logs, health checks, alerts, and metrics, you can ensure reliable operation and rapid incident response in a production deployment.
